# PingPong_Game
- The project involves designing and implementing a Ping Pong game using VHDL programming language and the VGA BASYS3 board. The game will have two paddles and a ball that will bounce back and forth between the paddles. The player will control one of the paddles and try to hit the ball back to the other side of the screen.
